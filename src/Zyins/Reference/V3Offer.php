/**
 * One product's v3 offer, returned identically by `POST /v3/prequalify`
 * and `POST /v3/quote`. Array order of `pricing` is authoritative for
 * display — there is no `result_index`, no client-side sort key, no
 * synthetic rank.
 *
 * `deathBenefit` is present (non-null) for life products
 * (fex/term/preneed) as a one-time lump sum (`period: null`); it is `null`
 * for premium-only products (medsup), whose coverage value lives entirely
 * in `pricing[].premium`. Always present as a field — `null` rather than
 * absent — so consumers null-check it. `budget` is present only on
 * monthly-budget quotes (`period: V3Period::Monthly`, the requested budget
 * — the stable grouping key for budget responses).
 *
 * `eligible` is a convenience field — equivalent to
 * `count(array_filter($pricing, fn ($r) => $r->eligibility->eligible)) > 0`.
