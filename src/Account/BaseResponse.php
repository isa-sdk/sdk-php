 * BaseResponse envelope wrapping every successful `isa.account.*`

 * and Python SDKs surface so callers can switch between languages
 * without re-learning the shape.
 *
 * `idempotencyKey` is documented but stub handlers do not populate it
 * everywhere; missing values surface as the empty string to keep the
 * shape stable.
 *
 * The `data` field is `mixed` at the envelope level — each per-resource
 * client narrows it to its typed value object via a dedicated
 * `fromWire()` factory before returning to the caller.
